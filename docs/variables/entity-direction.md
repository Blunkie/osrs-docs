# Entity Direction

Entity direction defines the angle at which an entity is facing. In OldSchool RuneScape, the direction variable is an integer with a value range of
0-2,047(inclusive). Zero is the equivalent of facing directly South, while 1,024 faces directly North. The direction goes clockwise and is evenly distributed.
